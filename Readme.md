Tic-Tac-Toe
Love is a game of tic-tac-toe,
Constantly waiting for the next x or o.

- Lang Leav -
Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three x's or three o's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares.

Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is played according to the following rules.

The game is played on a grid that is three squares by three squares.
Player one uses x's. Player two uses o's.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
If all nine squares are full and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
